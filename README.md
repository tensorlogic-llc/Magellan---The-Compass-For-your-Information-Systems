# Magellan

*the compass for your information systems*

Magellan is a purpose-built platform for cataloging, visualizing, and understanding your
organization’s information systems. It brings software, infrastructure, and business
processes into a single, navigable source of truth so you can see how everything connects,
who owns what, and where risk or gaps exist.

## What Magellan helps you do
- **Build a complete systems catalog** with ownership, criticality, compliance, and lifecycle details.
- **Visualize dependencies** across applications, infrastructure, and processes with interactive maps.
- **Surface risk and readiness** with built-in analytics and exportable reports.
- **Align teams** around shared terminology and a common picture of how systems interact.
- **Move faster** during planning, audits, and incidents by having the right context in one place.

## Why teams choose Magellan
- **Single source of truth** for software, infrastructure, and business processes.
- **Interactive maps** that turn complex relationships into a clear story.
- **Actionable insights** for risk, security posture, and lifecycle health.
- **Collaboration-ready** with role-based access and edit safeguards.
- **Designed for real-world operations**—simple to set up, easy to share.

## Who it’s for
Enterprise architecture, IT leadership, security teams, compliance, and operations teams
who need a reliable view of how their systems connect and where to focus next.

## Key capabilities
- **Rich system profiles** with ownership, vendors, lifecycle status, data sensitivity, and compliance tags.
- **Interactive maps** for dependencies, ownership views, and process flows with filtering and export.
- **Built-in reporting** for data quality, security posture, criticality, and dependency health.
- **Collaboration safeguards** like role-based access and edit-lock protections for shared databases.
- **Flexible data sharing** through exports and structured reports that support audits and planning.

## Getting started
For most teams, Magellan is installed via the desktop executable and configured through
the Setup Wizard. The wizard lets you create a new database or connect to an existing one,
including shared network locations.
